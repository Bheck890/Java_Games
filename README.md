# Java-Arcade-Games
A trial of re-creating the classic arcade games to figure out the code behind them<br />
learned the types of techonology and behaviors of game engines and how to create UI and user input <br />

## History
This project was the first program I made that was for fun and glad i am able to share it

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
I have learned the paining and refresh system that the applications use for games
as well as the positioning of objects and how they are identified in the UI's that we use
as well as the importance of using the right tool for the job and unsterand the limitations of
diffrent tools.
